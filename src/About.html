	<h2>Purpose</h2>
	<p>The primary goal of "Clean with Nora" is to gamify the often daunting task of cleaning and organizing one's living space. The game aims to  convey the therapeutic benefits of cleaning and maintaining a tidy environment by simulating the act of cleaning in a fun, engaging, and non-judgmental manner. The game hopes to motivate players to translate their virtual cleaning success into real-life actions.</p>

	<h2>Inspiration</h2>
	<p>Growing up, I would spend hours playing drag-and-drop doll and Barbie dress-up games online. In part, this childhood nostalgia inspired me to create a more mature game experience that keeps the heart of these beloved classics. </p>
	<p>The catalyst for this project was a story I stumbled upon which described research that was being conducted using gaming, including virtual reality, to assist individuals with mental health challenges like hoarding disorder. 'Clean with Nora' aims to harness the therapeutic power of gaming, encouraging players to practice decluttering skills in a supportive and engaging environment.</p>
